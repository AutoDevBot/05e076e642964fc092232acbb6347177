Frisby.js
================

The first testing framework we are supporting is [Frisby.js](http://frisbyjs.com/).  This is a really easy to use framework based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) for testing REST APIs.  Their website has some great tutorials on how to use it.  We are going to include some examples of our own also to make it even easier for you to get started.
